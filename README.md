# SQLBlindInjection
A solution for a Web Security Academy Exercise: Blind SQL Injection with Conditional Error.

# Requirements
This requires my C/C++ lib (lpop) https://github.com/NatteeSetobol/lpop and also requires libcurl-dev.

# why C/C++?
I could of have written this in python and I have done scripts in python before but I don't have a fast computer and I didn't want to wait a day for this to finish so I
just did it in C/C++ and it finished within a hour.
